# YouTube Clone With HTML and CSS - For HTML and CSS Beginners

This is a the UI of YouTube made with HTML and CSS. If you are learning HTML and CSS as a begginner, hope you will get something from this simple project including but not limited to:
1. CSS nested layouts: flexbox and Grid
2. Responsive web design with CSS media query
3. CSS positions: sticky, absolute, relative, fixed
4. and more

I strongly believe that the only way to learn coding is by doing. So, if you practice more and more projects in a regular basis, you will be a professional developer.
